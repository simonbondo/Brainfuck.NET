# Brainfuck.NET

This is a compiler for [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) using .NET written in C#. The eventual goal is to compile Brainfuck source into valid IL code, which can be executed by the dotnet runtime.

I felt inspired while following the [Compiler from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRAdsfhKI4OWNOSfS7EUu5GRAVmze1t2y) adventures by [@terrajobst](https://twitter.com/terrajobst), and wanted to see if I could apply some of the same lessons to an [esoteric programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language) like Brainfuck.
